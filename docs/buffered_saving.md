# Buffered Saving Performance Enhancement

## Overview

Implemented buffered saving for the Járokelő scraper to significantly improve performance during comprehensive scraping by reducing disk I/O operations from O(n) to O(n/buffer_size).

## Performance Results

Based on testing with 500 records:
- **Speedup**: 7.72x faster
- **Time saved**: 87.0%
- **I/O reduction**: From 500 writes to 10 batch writes (with buffer size 50)

## Implementation Details

### New Features

1. **BufferedDataManager**: 
   - Added `save_report_buffered()` method
   - Added `flush_buffer()` method  
   - Added context manager support
   - Records are buffered in memory by monthly file

2. **Smart Usage**:
   - **Comprehensive scraping**: Uses buffered saving automatically
   - **Status updates**: Uses regular saving (for immediate writes)
   - **Automatic flushing**: Buffer flushed when full or at end of scraping

3. **CLI Enhancement**:
   - Added `--buffer-size` parameter (default: 100)
   - Configurable buffer size for different use cases

### Code Changes

#### DataManager (data_manager.py)
- Added `buffer_size` parameter to constructor
- Added `buffer` and `buffer_count` instance variables
- Added `save_report_buffered()` method for memory buffering
- Added `flush_buffer()` method for batch writing
- Added context manager support (`__enter__`, `__exit__`)

#### Scraper Core (core.py)
- Modified constructor to accept `buffer_size` parameter
- Updated `scrape()` method to determine when to use buffering
- Modified listing page methods to support buffered/regular saving
- Added automatic buffer flushing in scraper's `__exit__`

#### CLI Script (scrape_data.py)
- Added `--buffer-size` CLI parameter
- Updated scraper initialization to pass buffer size

### Usage Examples

#### CLI Usage
```bash
# Default buffer size (100 records)
poetry run python ./scripts/scrape_data.py --backend beautifulsoup

# Custom buffer size for high-performance scraping
poetry run python ./scripts/scrape_data.py --backend beautifulsoup --buffer-size 200

# Status updates (buffering automatically disabled)
poetry run python ./scripts/scrape_data.py --update-existing-status
```

#### GitHub Actions Workflow
```bash
# Manual trigger with default buffer size (200)
gh workflow run scraper.yml

# Manual trigger with custom buffer size
gh workflow run scraper.yml --field buffer_size="300"

# Nightly automated run uses buffer size 200 by default
```

## Benefits

1. **Performance**: 7.72x faster comprehensive scraping
2. **Scalability**: Better performance for large scraping jobs
3. **Resource efficiency**: Reduced disk I/O and file operations
4. **Backward compatibility**: Existing functionality unchanged
5. **Smart optimization**: Only used when beneficial (comprehensive scraping)

## Technical Notes

- Buffering maintains chronological ordering of records
- Data integrity preserved through proper JSON serialization
- Memory usage scales with buffer size (typically minimal)
- Buffer automatically flushed on scraper exit or interruption
- Status updates still use immediate writes for real-time updates
