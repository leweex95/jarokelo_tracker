# Strategic EDA Plan for Járókelő Data Analysis

## Executive Summary
This EDA aims to create impactful, recruiter-focused data storytelling that demonstrates:
1. **Municipal Performance Analytics** - How effectively different institutions resolve citizen issues
2. **Citizen Engagement Insights** - Patterns in civic participation and issue reporting
3. **Urban Issues Intelligence** - Geographic and temporal patterns in infrastructure problems
4. **Operational Efficiency Metrics** - Resolution timeframes, escalation patterns, and success rates

## Key Research Questions & Metrics

### 1. Municipal Performance & Accountability
- **Institution Efficiency Score**: Resolution rate × Speed metric × Quality indicator
- **Response Time Analysis**: Time from report to first response, resolution time by category
- **Escalation Patterns**: Issues bounced between institutions, unresolved issues aging
- **Seasonal Performance**: How different institutions perform across seasons/months
- **Workload Distribution**: Which institutions are overwhelmed vs underutilized

### 2. Citizen Engagement Intelligence  
- **Community Health Score**: Reporting density, repeat reporters, community involvement
- **Issue Severity Classification**: Using description text analysis + update frequency
- **Citizen Satisfaction Proxy**: Status progression patterns, update quality
- **Geographic Engagement**: Hot spots of civic engagement vs apathetic areas
- **Digital Divide Analysis**: Author profile patterns, anonymous vs registered users

### 3. Urban Infrastructure Intelligence
- **Problem Clustering**: Geographic clusters of similar issues (infrastructure decay patterns)
- **Predictive Risk Mapping**: Areas likely to develop problems based on historical data
- **Category Evolution**: How issue types change over time, emerging problems
- **Infrastructure Age Correlation**: Relationship between location and issue frequency
- **Seasonal Issue Patterns**: Weather/season impact on different issue types

### 4. Operational Excellence Metrics
- **SLA Performance**: Meeting resolution timeframes by category/institution
- **Resource Allocation Efficiency**: Where resources are most/least effective
- **Inter-departmental Coordination**: Multi-institution issues resolution patterns
- **Communication Effectiveness**: Update frequency and quality correlation with resolution
- **Citizen Feedback Loop**: How updates affect citizen behavior and reporting

## Advanced Analytics to Implement

### Text Analytics
- **Issue Severity Scoring**: NLP-based urgency detection from descriptions
- **Sentiment Analysis**: Citizen frustration levels, institutional response tone
- **Topic Modeling**: Discover hidden patterns in issue descriptions
- **Update Quality Assessment**: Professional vs generic responses

### Geospatial Analytics  
- **Hot Spot Analysis**: Statistical clustering of issues
- **Service Accessibility**: Distance from reports to institutional offices
- **Urban Planning Insights**: Infrastructure patterns across districts
- **Demographic Correlation**: Connect with census data where possible

### Time Series Analytics
- **Trend Decomposition**: Seasonal, cyclical, and trend components
- **Forecasting**: Predict issue volumes and types
- **Performance Trajectory**: Improving vs declining institution performance
- **Workload Seasonality**: Plan resources based on historical patterns

### Network Analysis
- **Institution Collaboration Networks**: How departments work together
- **Issue Escalation Paths**: Common routing patterns for complex issues
- **Citizen Reporter Networks**: Repeat reporters and their effectiveness
