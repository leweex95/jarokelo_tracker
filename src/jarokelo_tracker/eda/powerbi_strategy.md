## Advanced PowerBI Features Implementation

### 1. DAX Measures for Key Calculations:
```dax
// Resolution Rate
Resolution Rate = 
DIVIDE(
    COUNTROWS(FILTER(Issues, Issues[is_resolved] = TRUE)),
    COUNTROWS(Issues)
)

// Average Resolution Time
Avg Resolution Days = 
AVERAGEX(
    FILTER(Issues, Issues[is_resolved] = TRUE),
    Issues[days_to_resolution]
)

// Performance Score (composite metric)
Performance Score = 
(0.4 * [Resolution Rate]) + 
(0.3 * [Response Time Score]) + 
(0.3 * [Communication Score])

// Trend Indicators
Resolution Trend = 
VAR CurrentMonth = [Resolution Rate]
VAR PreviousMonth = CALCULATE([Resolution Rate], DATEADD(Date[Date], -1, MONTH))
RETURN
IF(CurrentMonth > PreviousMonth, "↗", 
   IF(CurrentMonth < PreviousMonth, "↘", "→"))
```

### 2. Automated Refresh Strategy:
- **Executive Dashboard:** Once daily at 6 AM
- **Operational Dashboard:** Every 2 hours during business hours
- **Public Dashboard:** Once daily at 8 PM
